# state_prep_tools

The repository consists part of the [code](https://github.com/ShHsLin/qutepy-archive) from the TUM group on finding state prep circuits.
It utilizes the tensor networks and exact state vector simulation with fidelity optimization
to find the state preparation circuits for the target states.

The tools are now expanded to (plan to) include more features including but not only:
- state prep circuit found by energy minimization and more general geometry
- adding sparse pauli simulation as another simulation tools
- finding circuit to perform given basis transformation
